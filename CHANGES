Change log for bfilter
$Id: CHANGES,v 1.9 2006/05/20 16:10:44 chris Exp $

Fixed a crash bug in cleandb. Record log of `spam probaility' in
X-Spam-Probability header.

0.4

Fixed typos in man page. The help message now prints the bfilter version. Added
token history code, so that `Buy Cheap Viagra' now gives rise to the tokens
`buy%cheap', `cheap%viagra' and `buy%cheap%viagra', in addition to the
single-word ones used previously. Added a stats option for printing information
about the contents of the database. Changed cleandb to work by copying the
retained items to a new database file, then renaming it over the old one; this
is faster than the old method and should ensure that disk space is reclaimed
properly.

0.3

Fixed cleandb code. More error indications. Added tokeniser state machine
diagram, mostly as an experiment in graphviz. Uses TDB rather than GDBM, for
better concurrency. Does not use _ as a token separator when parsing
X-Spam-Status: headers, so bfilter can make better use of test results added
by Spam Assassin.

0.2

Added timestamps to database keys. Added cleandb option. Added X-Spam-Status:
(from Spam Assassin) to the list of headers to inspect. Changed the base
all-spam / all-real probabilities to 0.00001 / 0.99999.

0.1

Initial public release.
