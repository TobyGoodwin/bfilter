0.3

Fixed cleandb code. More error indications. Added tokeniser state machine
diagram, mostly as an experiment in graphviz. Uses TDB rather than GDBM, for
better concurrency. Does not use _ as a token separator when parsing
X-Spam-Status: headers, so bfilter can make better use of test results added
by Spam Assassin.

0.2

Added timestamps to database keys. Added cleandb option. Added X-Spam-Status:
(from Spam Assassin) to the list of headers to inspect. Changed the base
all-spam / all-real probabilities to 0.00001 / 0.99999.

0.1

Initial public release.
